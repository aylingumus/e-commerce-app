# Simple E-commerce App
Simple e-commerce app made with AngularJS, NodeJS and MySQL.

In server module we have a NodeJS application, in client module we have a AngularJS application. I've integrated AngularJS app on NodeJS app.

In this simple application we have two GET requests which list customer informations and subscription orders.
